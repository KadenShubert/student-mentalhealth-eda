### Exploratory Data Analysis of Student Mental health with depression prediction

This notebook aims to identify and illustrate any correlations between a student's mental health, academic program, academic performance, and personal factors.

### Problem Statement

Mental health issues are common among students but often go untreated or unnoticed. This project aims to reduce the levels of both unnoticed and untreated issues by analyzing this dataset to identify relationships within the collected data and use Machine Learning to both bolster that analysis and provide a way to identify if a student may be dealing with one of these conditions.

### Solution

For this solution I utilized a Random Forest Classification model trained on this data

### Repository Structure

The repository contains the following files:
